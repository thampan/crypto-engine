## Performance evaluation of a Crypto-Engine
In this project, we develop a crypto engine based on the sha-1 encryption scheme
both in hardware and software. We do a performance analysis of this implementation
in both the cases. Finally we do a hardware-software co-design and measure the performance
gains over running the crypto engine on software alone
